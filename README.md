this is a practice project. It's my first dive into pygame and OOP in python.
the characters are completely derived and not mine, I just pulled stuff off of google and altered them slightly.
artwork wil become more and more my own as the developement progresses. 
Update will likely show up here, if they are significant enough to note.
