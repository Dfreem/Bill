## Purpose ##
---
 %%figure out a better name for the genre%%
 Bill Game is a side-action flying game in which the player plays as a soaring 
 weapon. The name and and art is very likely to change over that coarse of development. The player will be given a choice of two starting characters, with the opportunity to earn access to more characters.

---
The game uses the state machine model, meaning:
- states are NOT to import, or refer to
